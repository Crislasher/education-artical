        <h1>AI Ethics Stream Added to National High School Curriculum</h1>
        <div class="meta">
            <span>By Education Futures Staff</span> | 
            <span>April 17, 2025</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>The Ministry of Education announced yesterday the addition of an AI Ethics stream to the national high school curriculum beginning in the 2025-2026 academic year. This groundbreaking initiative aims to prepare students for emerging career paths and address growing concerns about artificial intelligence's impact on society.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            <p>"Technology education must evolve beyond teaching students how to use tools to helping them critically evaluate the implications of those tools," said Education Minister Dr. Sarah Chen. "The AI Ethics stream represents a fundamental shift in how we prepare young people for a world where AI systems increasingly influence everyday life."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The new stream will be available to students in grades 10-12 and includes foundational courses in:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Principles of Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>Ethics and Philosophy of Technology</li>
            <li>Data Privacy and Digital Rights</li>
            <li>Algorithmic Bias and Fairness</li>
            <li>AI Policy and Governance</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Early pilot programs in selected schools have shown promising results, with students demonstrating improved critical thinking about technology and increased interest in interdisciplinary careers combining technology with ethics, policy, and humanities.</p>
        
        <p>"What makes this curriculum unique is its interdisciplinary approach," explained Dr. Marcus Wong, who led the curriculum development committee. "Students will engage with AI topics through multiple lenses—technical, ethical, social, and political—rather than treating these as separate domains."</p>
        
        <p>Industry partners including major technology companies have pledged support for the initiative through guest lectures, internship opportunities, and curriculum resources. However, the ministry emphasized that the program maintains educational independence and critical perspectives on technology.</p>
        
        <p>The AI Ethics stream joins existing specialized streams in STEM, Humanities, Business, and Creative Arts available to high school students. Educational advisors anticipate approximately 15% of students will opt for the new stream in its first year, with enrollment expected to grow as awareness of AI-related career opportunities increases.</p>
        
        <p>For schools with limited resources, the ministry has developed a hybrid implementation model combining online modules with in-person instruction. Teacher training programs will begin this summer, with specialized certification available for educators transitioning from computer science, philosophy, and social studies backgrounds.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            <p>"Today's students will shape how AI is developed and deployed in the coming decades," noted Dr. Chen. "This educational stream ensures they'll do so with not just technical skills, but ethical frameworks and critical perspectives."</p>
